        <div class="message-text">Hi baby!!

I just wanted to take some time to tell you how amazing you are baby.
Dating you for the past couple months has truly been the most amazing experience. Also! We really need to finish our clay stuff like that was so much fun baby. Like ughhh you dont know how much I love hanging out with you. Like ik this is random but like there is no girl in this world that I would rather hang out with during the snow storm other than you. It was sooo much fun like dang baby. Sorry for the random tangent lol but hanging out with you and spending time with you is so amazing. You treat me so well and your always there for me when I need you. Plus... your an amazing cuddler! Like soooo amazing.

Anyways baby, your truly so amazing in every way possible. I not only want you to be my valentine this year like last year, but I want you to be my valentine forever -- till the end of time essentially. Ik you think its early to say and weve had a few issues here and there but baby, I love you so much I want and need you forever. There is absolutely no one I can imagine doing anything with in life other than YOU. Like who in the world could give me a birthday celebration even remotely close to how amazing my birthday was with you?? Absolutley no one. Its impossible like I still think about that night and how perfect it was. From the amazing food, to the amazing cuddles, I still cant get over it like I need to take you to downtown again for another fancy date like ughhh your so beautiful you dont know how nice it was alone just looking at you in awe at dinner. Like it was literally our first starbucks date all over again. I dont want to go on and on like I truly want to because all of my good words are in something for actual valentines day but just know, I love you more than anything on this planet or in this whole world and that you truly the most beautiful, perfect, sweet, funny, smart girl in the world.

Other than that... Im sorry if this proposal seems a bit weak but it really sucks shopping for you because its like dang once I find something I want to get you I can't wait for anything but this time ive really locked in and im holding mostly everything for actual valentines day. Ughh yeah I was even gonna get you flowers but you made it clear you dont like flowers so I dont want to be a crappy boyfriend and get you some anyways lol soo... it looks like you have nothing for now. Oh except this! Ik you love them sooo soo much so go have fun tonight!! Call me if you can I want to watch lol. Other than this tho, expect some pretty cool stuff because I have really been trying hard to give you a perfect valentines day to match how perfect you are yk!! Ohhh!! Take this too!! And take one or two free all you can eat sushi coupon!! You just gotta kiss me to claim them tho...

Love,
Troy
